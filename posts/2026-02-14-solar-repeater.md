# New Solar Repeater Deployed on North Ridge

We are excited to announce the successful deployment of our first solar-powered repeater node at a prime location on North Ridge. This milestone marks a significant advancement in our network infrastructure and coverage area.

## The Hardware

The new repeater is based on the **RAK19007 WisGate Connect** running the latest MeshCore firmware. Key specifications include:

- **Long-Range LoRa Radio**: 868/915 MHz ISM band support
- **Solar Panel**: 10W panel with weatherproof enclosure
- **Battery Backup**: 10,000mAh lithium battery pack
- **Mounting**: Robust aluminum pole mount for long-term durability

## Coverage Results

Initial coverage testing shows excellent range:

- **Direct LOS Coverage**: 18km radius in optimal conditions
- **Building Penetration**: 4-5 stories of concrete/steel
- **Network Reliability**: 99.2% uptime during testing phase

The south vector provides reliable coverage down to the Bexley-Columbus border, extending our network significantly.

## Next Steps

We are currently planning the second repeater deployment for early March. If you are interested in hosting a repeater node on your property or business, please reach out via Discord or email.

Thank you to everyone who contributed to making this deployment a success!
