# Welcome to BexleyMesh

We're thrilled to launch the BexleyMesh community network project! This website serves as the central hub for information about our initiative to build a resilient, off-grid mesh communication network in Bexley, Ohio.

## What is BexleyMesh?

BexleyMesh is a community-driven project to deploy a mesh network using low-power, long-range LoRa radio technology. Unlike traditional communication infrastructure that depends on cellular networks or the internet, a mesh network allows devices to communicate directly with each other, with the ability to relay messages across larger distances through multiple nodes.

## Why This Matters

- **Resilience**: Communication that works without relying on external infrastructure
- **Privacy**: Messages stay within the community network
- **Emergency Response**: Functional communication when traditional systems fail
- **Community**: Building local capacity and knowledge sharing
- **Freedom**: Open-source hardware and software accessible to all

## How It Works

Participants deploy small LoRa radio "nodes" (repeaters) throughout the coverage area. These nodes automatically form a mesh network, allowing text messages, location sharing, and data collection without needing cell towers or internet connectivity.

## Getting Started

### For Users

1. Purchase a compatible LoRa device (RAK3272S or RAK4631)
2. Flash the MeshCore firmware using our [Firmware Flasher](https://flasher.meshcore.co.uk/)
3. Configure your device and join the network
4. See our [Getting Started Guide](post.html?post=2026-02-10-getting-started)

### For Hardware Contributors

If you have a suitable location for a repeater node:

1. Contact us via [Discord](https://discord.com/channels/1280671076644425749/1280693593002082436)
2. Discuss your location and local coverage impact
3. Participate in deployment and testing
4. Help expand our network reach

### For Developers

## Roadmap

- **Phase 1 (Now)**: Establish core infrastructure with 3-5 repeater nodes
- **Phase 2 (Q1 2026)**: Expand coverage to entire Bexley area
- **Phase 3 (Q2 2026)**: Integrate with Central Ohio Mesh network
- **Phase 4 (Future)**: Mobile applications and advanced features
