# About BexleyMesh

BexleyMesh is a community-driven project dedicated to building a resilient, off-grid mesh communication network in the Bexley, Ohio area. Using low-power, long-range LoRa radios running the MeshCore firmware, we enable text communication and GPS location sharing without reliance on cellular towers or the internet.

## Our Mission

We believe every community should have access to communication infrastructure that works even when traditional networks fail. Whether it's a severe weather event, a power outage, or simply an interest in decentralized technology, BexleyMesh provides a reliable alternative.

## What We Do

- **Deploy Repeaters** - We install solar-powered repeater nodes at strategic locations throughout the Bexley area to extend network coverage and reliability.
- **Support New Members** - We help community members get set up with compatible hardware and walk them through the process of joining the network.
- **Educate & Share** - We publish guides, tutorials, and project updates to help others learn about mesh networking technology.
- **Collaborate** - We work alongside the broader Central Ohio Mesh community and the MeshCore open-source project.

## How It Works

Our network is built on [MeshCore](https://meshcore.co.uk) firmware running on affordable LoRa radio hardware. Messages hop between nodes automatically, creating a self-healing mesh that doesn't depend on any single point of failure.

**Repeater nodes** are fixed installations (often solar-powered) that relay messages across the network. **Companion nodes** are handheld devices carried by community members. Together, they form a communication grid that covers the local area.

## Get Involved

There are many ways to participate:

1. **Get a Radio** - Pick up a compatible LoRa device and join the network. See our [Getting Started](page.html?page=getting-started) guide.
2. **Host a Repeater** - If you have a good location (rooftop, high elevation), consider hosting a repeater node.
3. **Join the Community** - Connect with us on [Discord](https://discord.com/channels/1280671076644425749/1280693593002082436) to ask questions and share your experiences.
4. **Contribute** - This is an open-source project. Visit our [GitHub](https://github.com/DavidJayMartin/BexleyMesh) to contribute code, documentation, or ideas.
