# BexleyMesh Website Development Plan

## Project Vision & Goals

**Primary Vision:**
Create a professional, community-focused website for the BexleyMesh project that serves as the central hub for awareness, documentation, and project updates about the off-grid mesh network deployment in Bexley, Ohio.

**Primary Goals:**
1. **Community Awareness**: Establish legitimacy and credibility of the BexleyMesh project for stakeholders and property owners
2. **Knowledge Sharing**: Provide comprehensive documentation and help guides for community members wanting to contribute to the network
3. **Project Transparency**: Share ongoing updates about network development, deployments, and milestones through blog posts and articles
4. **Live Network Status**: Display real-time information about active repeater nodes and network health

## Technical Architecture Overview

### Frontend (GitHub Pages)
- **Framework**: Static HTML/CSS/JavaScript (no build tool required)
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS (already implemented via CDN)
- **Icons**: Font Awesome (already implemented via CDN)
- **Content**: Markdown files converted to HTML at build/deployment time
- **Responsive Design**: Design layout will be responsive to a variety of sreen resolutions and aspect ratios

### Data Management
- **Blog Posts**: Markdown files stored in `posts/` directory
- **Repeater Status**: JSON file (`data/repeater-status.json`) updated via GitHub Actions
- **Configuration**: YAML front-matter in Markdown files for metadata (title, date, tags, author)

### Backend/Automation
- **GitHub Actions Workflow**: Python script that runs on schedule
  - Connects to MQTT broker
  - Queries repeater status from analyzer.letsmesh.net or MQTT topics
  - Generates JSON output file
  - Commits changes to repository (automatic deployment to GitHub Pages)
  - Frequency: Every 5 minutes

### Deployment
- **Hosting**: GitHub Pages (free, built-in to repository)
- **Domain**: bexleymesh.org (custom domain, already configured)
- **Deployment Pipeline**: Automatic on every commit to main branch

## Milestones & Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation
- Set up project repository structure
- Implement static blog infrastructure with Markdown parsing
- Create initial blog post and documentation pages
- Establish GitHub Actions workflow setup

### Phase 2: Dynamic Features
- Implement repeater status polling script (Python)
- Set up GitHub Actions workflow to run on schedule
- Create JSON data schema for repeater status
- Implement frontend display of live repeater status

### Phase 3: Polish & Launch
- Test all features across browsers and devices
- Optimize performance and loading times
- Final content review and documentation
- Deploy to production (bexleymesh.org)
- Monitor and iterate based on feedback

### Phase 4: Future Enhancements
- Historical data tracking for repeaters
- Advanced analytics and charts
- Community contribution features
- Mobile app companion (future consideration)

## Success Metrics

1. **Website Accessibility**
   - Site loads in < 3 seconds on standard broadband
   - Mobile-friendly and responsive on all device sizes
   - Meets WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility standards

2. **Content Management**
   - Ability to publish new blog posts without code changes (Markdown only)
   - Blog posts display correctly with proper formatting and metadata
   - All tags and categories function as expected

3. **Live Data Integration**
   - Repeater status updates every 5 minutes
   - JSON data is valid and parseable
   - Frontend correctly displays live status information
   - Zero downtime during updates

4. **Community Engagement**
   - Clear pathways to Discord and external resources
   - Coverage map is functional and informative
   - Documentation is comprehensive and easy to navigate

5. **Legitimacy & Professionalism**
   - Site presents professional appearance suitable for stakeholder outreach
   - Project information is clear and compelling
   - Technical credibility is established through documentation

## Known Constraints & Risks

### Constraints
- **GitHub Pages Limitations**: Static hosting only, no server-side processing
- **GitHub Actions**: Limited to 2000 minutes/month on free tier (not an issue with 5-min updates)
- **MQTT Connectivity**: Depends on network availability and credentials
- **Single Developer**: Only owner managing blog posts and deployments (future scaling consideration)

### Risks
- **MQTT Broker Downtime**: If broker is unavailable, status won't update (mitigation: error handling in script)
- **Data Staleness**: If Actions fail silently, old data could be displayed (mitigation: add timestamp visibility)
- **Scope Creep**: Feature requests may expand beyond initial scope (mitigation: prioritize ruthlessly)
- **Maintenance Burden**: As blog grows, managing posts could become unwieldy (mitigation: consider CMS integration later)

## Dependencies

### External Systems
- MQTT Broker (for repeater status data)
- analyzer.letsmesh.net (potential data source)
- cmh.meshmapper.net (coverage map embedding)
- Discord server
- GitHub Pages hosting
- Custom domain DNS
- Google Analytics (web traffic monitoring)

### Technologies & Libraries
- Tailwind CSS (already in use)
- Font Awesome icons (already in use)
- GitHub Actions (free tier)
- Python 3.x with paho-mqtt library
- Static site generation (Jekyll recommended for GitHub Pages integration)

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate**: Confirm final technical approach and MQTT connectivity details
2. **Short-term**: Begin Phase 1 development with repository structure and blog infrastructure
3. **Short-term**: Create initial blog posts and documentation pages
4. **Medium-term**: Implement repeater status script and GitHub Actions workflow
5. **Medium-term**: Deploy to production and monitor for issues
